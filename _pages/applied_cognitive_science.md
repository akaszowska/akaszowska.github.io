## reading companion to Don Norman's _the Design of Everyday Things_
download **[slides](https://akaszowska.github.io/files/DesignOfEverydayThings_companion.pdf)** and **[notes](https://akaszowska.github.io/files/DesignOfEverydayThings_companion_notes.pdf)**

Explains basic terms from the book: affordances, signifiers, discoverability, understanding, mapping, feedback, conceptual and mental models, system image, gulfs of execution and evaluation, stages of action and processing, knowledge in the world and in the head, and error classification. Detours into Gibson's perception-action cycle, Clark&Chalmers' extended mind argument, Gawande's checklist manifesto, and Asch's obedience experiments.
