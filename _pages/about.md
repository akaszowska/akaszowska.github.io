Hi, 

(about me)

My work and research
======
(about my work, get in touch for portfolio of results etc.)

This website
======
This is a repository of (slightly edited) teaching materials that I've developed over the years as a university lecturer. They span presentations and notes from content-heavy lectures, case studies, ideas for projects and practical exercises, and materials from skills development workshops. 

Please note: this website is under construction, I upload new materials as I edit them. 

Whether you're a teacher looking for new ideas, a student wanting to dig deeper into a topic, or a professional in need of a refresher or a new perspective for your projects, I hope you'll find something useful here.
