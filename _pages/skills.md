**[download pdf](https://akaszowska.github.io/files/GivingPresentations.pdf)**

Giving presentations, and public speaking in general, often fills people with dread. This guide is written for inexperienced presenters and beginners who are not quite sure how to go about preparing and practicing their presentations, and becoming more confident in front of an audience. It presents a few starting points and considerations for setting up a public talk, building a slide deck, presenting it, and managing anxiety in front of an audience. It was written with university students and young academics in mind, but can apply more widely to any novices who are faced with the daunting task of delivering a presentation.
